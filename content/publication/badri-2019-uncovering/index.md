abstract: Hyaluronan (HA), a glycosaminoglycan with important medical applications,
  is commercially produced from pathogenic microbial sources. The metabolism of HA-producing
  recombinant generally regarded as safe (GRAS) systems needs to be more strategically
  engineered to achieve yields higher than native producers. Here, we use a genome-scale
  model (GEM) to account for the entire metabolic network of the cell while predicting
  strategies to improve HA production. We analyze the metabolic network of Lactococcus
  lactis adapted to produce HA and identify non-conventional strategies to enhance
  HA flux. We also show experimental verification of one of the predicted strategies.
  We thus identified an alternate route for enhancement of HA synthesis, originating
  from the nucleoside inosine, that can function in parallel with the traditionally
  known route from glucose. Adopting this strategy resulted in a 2.8-fold increase
  in HA yield. The strategies identified and the experimental results show that the
  cell is capable of involving a larger subset of metabolic pathways in HA production.
  Apart from being the first report to use a nucleoside to improve HA production,
  we demonstrate the role of experimental validation in model refinement and strategy
  improvisation. Overall, we point out that well-constructed GEMs could be used to
  derive efficient strategies to improve the biosynthesis of high-value products.
