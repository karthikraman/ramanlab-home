abstract: Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the focus of several investigations for design
  of newer drugs, as tuberculosis remains a major epidemic despite the availability
  of several drugs and a vaccine. Mycobacteria owe many of their unique qualities
  to mycolic acids, which are known to be important for their growth, survival, and
  pathogenicity. Mycolic acid biosynthesis has therefore been the focus of a number
  of biochemical and genetic studies. It also turns out to be the pathway inhibited
  by front-line anti-tubercular drugs such as isoniazid and ethionamide. Recent years
  have seen the emergence of systems-based methodologies that can be used to study
  microbial metabolism. Here, we seek to apply insights from flux balance analyses
  of the mycolic acid pathway (MAP) for the identification of anti-tubercular drug
  targets. We present a comprehensive model of mycolic acid synthesis in the pathogen
  M. tuberculosis involving 197 metabolites participating in 219 reactions catalysed
  by 28 proteins. Flux balance analysis (FBA) has been performed on the MAP model,
  which has provided insights into the metabolic capabilities of the pathway. In silico
  systematic gene deletions and inhibition of InhA by isoniazid, studied here, provide
  clues about proteins essential for the pathway and hence lead to a rational identification
  of possible drug targets. Feasibility studies using sequence analysis of the M.
  tuberculosis H37Rv and human proteomes indicate that, apart from the known InhA,
  potential targets for anti-tubercular drug design are AccD3, Fas, FabH, Pks13, DesA1/2,
  and DesA3. Proteins identified as essential by FBA correlate well with those previously
  identified experimentally through transposon site hybridisation mutagenesis. This
  study demonstrates the application of FBA for rational identification of potential
  anti-tubercular drug targets, which can indeed be a general strategy in drug design.
  The targets, chosen based on the critical points in the pathway, form a ready shortlist
  for experimental testing.
