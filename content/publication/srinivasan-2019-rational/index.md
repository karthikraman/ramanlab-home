abstract: Alpha-tocopherol, an essential dietary supplement, synthesized by photosynthetic
  organisms is the most biologically active antioxidant component of vitamin E in
  humans. Attempts to improve the yield of alpha-tocopherol using plant cell cultures
  has gained significance in recent years. Here, we developed a high alpha-tocopherol
  yielding cell line of Helianthus annuus using a model based metabolic engineering
  approach. To this end, we adapted an available genome-scale model of Arabidopsis
  for simulating H. annuus metabolism using constraint-based analysis to identify
  and rank suitable enzyme targets for overexpression. Of the various model-predicted
  enzyme targets, majority belonged to the vitamin E pathway and the MEP pathway while
  the others included reactions from the nucleotide biosynthesis and amino acid metabolism.
  Experimental validation of the top strategy (overexpression of p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate
  dioxygenase,) resulted in a high alpha-tocopherol yielding transformed cell line
  (up to ˜240 µg g-1), which was ˜10-fold more than in the untransformed cell line.
  A cell suspension was developed from the selected transformed cell line for in vitro
  production of alpha-tocopherol, which resulted in a maximum alpha-tocopherol yield
  of 412.2 µg g-1 and titre of 6.4 mg L-1.We thus demonstrate the utility of model-based
  metabolic engineering for multi-fold yield enhancement of commercially important
  plant secondary metabolites.
