abstract: Tuberculosis still remains one of the largest killer infectious diseases,
  warranting the identification of newer targets and drugs. Identification and validation
  of appropriate targets for designing drugs are critical steps in drug discovery,
  which are at present major bottle-necks. A majority of drugs in current clinical
  use for many diseases have been designed without the knowledge of the targets, perhaps
  because standard methodologies to identify such targets in a high-throughput fashion
  do not really exist. With different kinds of 'omics' data that are now available,
  computational approaches can be powerful means of obtaining short-lists of possible
  targets for further experimental validation. We report a comprehensive in silico
  target identification pipeline, targetTB, for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The pipeline
  incorporates a network analysis of the protein-protein interactome, a flux balance
  analysis of the reactome, experimentally derived phenotype essentiality data, sequence
  analyses and a structural assessment of targetability, using novel algorithms recently
  developed by us. Using flux balance analysis and network analysis, proteins critical
  for survival of M. tuberculosis are first identified, followed by comparative genomics
  with the host, finally incorporating a novel structural analysis of the binding
  sites to assess the feasibility of a protein as a target. Further analyses include
  correlation with expression data and non-similarity to gut flora proteins as well
  as 'anti-targets' in the host, leading to the identification of 451 high-confidence
  targets. Through phylogenetic profiling against 228 pathogen genomes, shortlisted
  targets have been further explored to identify broad-spectrum antibiotic targets,
  while also identifying those specific to tuberculosis. Targets that address mycobacterial
  persistence and drug resistance mechanisms are also analysed. The pipeline developed
  provides rational schema for drug target identification that are likely to have
  high rates of success, which is expected to save enormous amounts of money, resources
  and time in the drug discovery process. A thorough comparison with previously suggested
  targets in the literature demonstrates the usefulness of the integrated approach
  used in our study, highlighting the importance of systems-level analyses in particular.
  The method has the potential to be used as a general strategy for target identification
  and validation and hence significantly impact most drug discovery programmes.
