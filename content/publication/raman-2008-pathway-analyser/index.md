abstract: Stoichiometric and constraint-based analyses of metabolic pathways have
  been gaining ground in the recent past with the increase in the quality and number
  of pathway databases available and the curation of genome-scale metabolic models.
  Genome-scale metabolic models of several organisms such as Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces
  cerevisiae and Staphylococcus aureus have already been constructed. Flux Balance
  Analysis (FBA) and Minimisation of Metabolic Adjustment (MoMA) are two of the popular
  techniques for the constraint-based analysis of metabolic pathways.We have developed
  a computational tool, PathwayAnalyser, for the analysis of metabolic pathways, particularly
  by FBA and MoMA. PathwayAnalyser interfaces with the open-source GNU Linear Programming
  Toolkit (GLPK) for linear programming/FBA and Object Oriented Quadratic Programming
  (OOQP) for quadratic programming/MoMA. It gives a comprehensive report on gene deletions
  from the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) Model and objective function input
  for FBA. PathwayAnalyser is open-source and is available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/pathwayanalyser
