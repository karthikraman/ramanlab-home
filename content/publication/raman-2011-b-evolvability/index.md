abstract: Biological systems at various levels of organisation exhibit robustness,
  as well as phenotypic variability or evolvability, the ability to evolve novel phenotypes.
  We still know very little about the relationship between robustness and phenotypic
  variability at levels of organisation beyond individual macromolecules, and especially
  for signalling circuits. Here, we examine multiple alternate topologies of the Saccharomyces
  cerevisiae target-of-rapamycin (TOR) signalling circuit, in order to understand
  the circuit's robustness and phenotypic variability. We consider each of the topological
  variants a genotype, a set of alternative interactions between TOR circuit components.
  Two genotypes are neighbours in genotype space if they can be reached from each
  other by a single small genetic change. Each genotype (topology) has a signalling
  phenotype, which we define via the concentration trajectories of key signalling
  molecules. We find that the circuits we study can produce almost 300 different phenotypes.
  The number of genotypes with a given phenotype varies very widely among these phenotypes.
  Some phenotypes have few associated genotypes. Others have many genotypes that form
  genotype networks extending far through genotype space. A minority of phenotypes
  accounts for the vast majority of genotypes. Importantly, we find that these phenotypes
  tend to have large genotype networks, greater robustness and a greater ability to
  produce novel phenotypes. Thus, over a broad range of phenotypic robustness, robustness
  facilitates phenotypic variability in our study system. Our observations show parallels
  to studies on macromolecules, suggesting that similar principles might govern robustness
  and phenotypic variability in biological systems. Our approach points a way towards
  mapping genotype spaces in complex circuitry, and it exposes some challenges such
  mapping faces.
