abstract: Designing biological networks that are capable of achieving specific functionality
  has been of sustained interest in the field of synthetic biology for nearly a decade.
  Adaptation is one such important functionality that is observed in bacterial chemotaxis,
  cell signalling and homoeostasis. It refers to the ability of a cell to cope with
  environmental perturbations. All of these adaptation networks, involve negative
  feedback loops or open loop control strategies. A typical enzymatic network is a
  circuit of enzymes whose connections are characterized by enzymatic reactions that
  exhibit non-linear dynamics. Previous approaches to design of enzymatic networks
  capable of perfect adaptation have used brute force searches encompassing the complete
  set of possibilities to identify suitable circuit designs. In contrast, this work
  presents a systematic algorithm for circuit design, using a linear systems-theoretic
  approach. The key idea is to set up a design-oriented problem formulation as against
  employing a brute force search in the space of possible circuits. To this effect,
  we first linearize the non-linear dynamical circuit, subsequently, we translate
  the requirements for adaptation to design specifications for a linear time-invariant
  system and imposing these design specifications on the linearized system, we obtain
  the minimal topologies or motifs that can perform perfect adaptation, with an optimal
  set of rate constants. The optimal set of rate constants is obtained by solving
  a structure-specific constrained optimisation problem. In effect, we demonstrate
  that the proposed approach identifies the key motifs of the biological network that
  were identified by the existing brute force approach, albeit in a systematic manner
  and with very little computational effort.
