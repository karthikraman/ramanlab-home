abstract: Mycolic acids, which render unique qualities to mycobacteria, are known
  to be important for mycobacterial growth, survival, and pathogenicity. It is of
  interest to understand the evolutionary origins of the mycolic acid pathway (MAP),
  as well as the common minimum principles critical for generating the capability
  of mycolic acid biosynthesis. The recent curation of a comprehensive model of the
  MAP in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the availability of a large number of genome
  sequences make it feasible to carry out detailed sequence and phylogenetic analyses,
  to address these questions. A comprehensive phylogenetic pathway profile analysis
  was carried out for 318 fully sequenced bacterial genomes, for each of the proteins
  present in the MAP. The organisms were clustered on the basis of co-occurrence of
  the MAP proteins in their proteome, while the proteins were clustered on the basis
  of their phylogenetic profiles. The MAP proteins were also searched against the
  nonredundant sequence database, to identify similar proteins from other phyla. The
  pathway profiles indicate that four proteins and certain protein domains stand out
  as more characteristic to mycolate producing organisms. Further analysis leads to
  the identification of the desaturases DesA1 and DesA2 and certain domains of Fas
  and Pks13 as hallmarks of the pathway. The roles of these proteins in some other
  organisms, as well as the distribution of these proteins across all known genome
  sequences are also briefly discussed. The clustering of organisms, carried out to
  group organisms with similar profiles, provides a means of obtaining finer classification
  as compared to the standard taxonomic method. The results indicate that the MAP
  and hence the capacity of mycolic acid production in mycobacteria is an example
  of an emergent property that has come about by recruiting enzymes from unrelated
  pathways in plants, presumably through lateral gene transfer. The understanding
  of the hallmarks of mycolic acid biosynthesis will also find application in evaluating
  drug targets. Proteins 2007. oÌ§pyright 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
