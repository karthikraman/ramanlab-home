abstract: The potential of systems-based approaches are increasingly being realised
  in drug discovery, metabolic engineering and related areas. Developments in high-throughput
  experimental techniques and explosion of genomic data have fuelled progress in this
  area. Modelling and simulation of metabolic and regulatory pathways is an important
  step in systems analysis. In this review, we discuss the principles of pathway modelling,
  simulation techniques and current practices. A pre-requisite for modelling and simulating
  metabolic pathways is an accurate description of the pathway landscape. Despite
  availability of hundreds of annotated genome sequences, accurate information about
  pathways is still largely incomplete. We highlight some of the methods for deriving
  pathway landscapes from biochemical literature and high-throughput experimental
  data. The conceptual framework for modelling in terms of abstraction levels and
  schema for representation is also presented.  Next, several classes of techniques
  available for modelling and simulating such systems formulated from pathway landscapes,
  viz. kinetic pathway modelling, interaction-based modelling and constraint-based
  modelling are discussed. The Systems Biology Markup Language as well as various
  pathway design and simulation tools are reviewed. The usefulness of various concepts
  and methodologies in areas such as drug discovery and metabolic engineering are
  illustrated with examples from literature, with a note on future perspectives.
