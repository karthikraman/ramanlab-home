abstract: Tuberculosis continues to be a major health challenge, warranting the need
  for newer strategies for therapeutic intervention and newer approaches to discover
  them. Here, we report the identification of efficient metabolism disruption strategies
  by analysis of a reactome network. Protein-protein dependencies at a genome scale
  are derived from the curated metabolic network, from which insights into the nature
  and extent of inter-protein and inter-pathway dependencies have been obtained. A
  functional distance matrix and a subsequent nearness index derived from this information,
  helps in understanding how the influence of a given protein can pervade to the metabolic
  network. Thus, the nearness index can be viewed as a metabolic disruptability index,
  which suggests possible strategies for achieving maximal metabolic disruption by
  inhibition of the least number of proteins. A greedy approach has been used to identify
  the most influential singleton, and its combination with the other most pervasive
  proteins to obtain highly influential pairs, triplets and quadruplets. The effect
  of deletion of these combinations on cellular metabolism has been studied by flux
  balance analysis. An obvious outcome of this study is a rational identification
  of drug targets, to efficiently bring down mycobacterial metabolism.
