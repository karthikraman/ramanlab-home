abstract: Retinoblastoma (RB) is a childhood eye cancer. Currently, chemotherapy,
  local therapy, and enucleation are the main ways in which these tumors are managed.
  The present work is the first study that uses constraint-based reconstruction and
  analysis approaches to identify and explain RB-specific survival strategies, which
  are RB tumor specific. Importantly, our model-specific secretion profile is also
  found in RB1-depleted human retinal cells inï¿½vitro and suggests that novel biomarkers
  involved in lipid metabolism may be important. Finally, RB-specific synthetic lethals
  have been predicted as lipid and nucleoside transport proteins that can aid in novel
  drug target development.
