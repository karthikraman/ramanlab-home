abstract: Mutations in the hydrophobic interior of proteins are generally thought
  to weaken the interactions only in their immediate neighborhood. This forms the
  basis of protein engineering-based studies of folding mechanism and function. However,
  mutational work on diverse proteins has shown that distant residues are thermodynamically
  coupled, with the network of interactions within the protein acting as signal conduits,
  thus raising an intriguing paradox. Are mutational effects localized, and if not,
  is there a general rule for the extent of percolation and the functional form of
  this propagation? We explore these questions from multiple perspectives in this
  work. Perturbation analysis of interaction networks within proteins and microsecond
  long molecular dynamics simulations of several aliphatic mutants of ubiquitin reveal
  strong evidence of the distinct alteration of distal residue-residue communication
  networks. We find that mutational effects consistently propagate into the second
  shell of the altered site (even up to 15-20 Å) in proportion to the perturbation
  magnitude and dissipate exponentially with a decay distance constant of ∼4-5 Å.
  We also report evidence for this phenomenon from published experimental nuclear
  magnetic resonance data that strikingly resemble predictions from network theory
  and molecular dynamics simulations. Reformulating these observations onto a statistical
  mechanical model, we reproduce the stability changes of 375 mutations from 19 single-domain
  proteins. Our work thus reveals a robust energy dissipation-cum-signaling mechanism
  in the interaction network within proteins, quantifies the partitioning of destabilization
  energetics around the mutation neighborhood, and presents a simple theoretical framework
  for modeling the allosteric effects of point mutations.
