abstract: Bifidobacteria, the initial colonisers of breastfed infant guts, are considered
  as the key commensals that promote a healthy gastrointestinal tract. However, little
  is known about the key metabolic differences between different strains of these
  bifidobacteria, and consequently, their suitability for their varied commercial
  applications. In this context, the present study applies a constraint-based modelling
  approach to differentiate between 36 important bifidobacterial strains, enhancing
  their genome-scale metabolic models obtained from the AGORA (Assembly of Gut Organisms
  through Reconstruction and Analysis) resource. By studying various growth and metabolic
  capabilities in these enhanced genome-scale models across 30 different nutrient
  environments, we classified the bifidobacteria into three specific groups. We also
  studied the ability of the different strains to produce short-chain fatty acids,
  finding that acetate production is niche- and strain-specific, unlike lactate. Further,
  we captured the role of critical enzymes from the bifid shunt pathway, which was
  found to be essential for a subset of bifidobacterial strains. Our findings underline
  the significance of analysing metabolic capabilities as a powerful approach to explore
  distinct properties of the gut microbiome. Overall, our study presents several insights
  into the nutritional lifestyles of bifidobacteria and could potentially be leveraged
  to design species/strain-specific probiotics or prebiotics.
